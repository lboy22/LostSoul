Game takes place in a 2D-plane. The art style is minimalistic, and characters, environment, background and every other visual element will be outlined, meaning that all visuals will have an purely outline look.

The theme of this game is "Bridges". We took a philosophical interpretation and will explore how the human soul is an element that all that makes us who we are, that being both the good and the bad.

In the game, our protagonist will is in a journey where he find himself at a crossroads in search of the soul of his recently (immediately) deceased friend whose soul is calling/guiding him into the depths of who he once was.

The player will then control the protagonist in a XY-axis plane and by 'clicking' on specific points of attention, a ladder will extend from the avatar into the location where the 'click' ocurred within the object of interest.

The game's level will be seen as in a frame of a polaroid picture, a frame view whose southern border follows. 

The points of interest will be placed in vertically aligned places to always move in a vertical position.

As we ascend up or down, we the player will see new points of interest that represent memories of their friend's life in the view of their respected behavior (good or bad).

When the player reaches the final frame of their friend's life, a last object of interest will be in the center of the frame's background, it'll be their friend's soul.

If the player clicks on it they will be presented with dialogue from the player, it will ask the player if certain memories were good, great, awesome, bad, cruel or harsh.

If the player select 2/3 of the memories to be negative, they will leave the soul in the upper or lower if found there.

If the player selects/finds all of the collectibles found throughout their journey, they are presented with a bonus ending/message/poem/etc.
